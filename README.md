# Code Crypt

Code Crypt provides a simple Python library and command line interface to
manage your application secrets within a project repository. Master keys are
managed externally by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS), which perform
envelope encryption on a RSA private key used for decrypts on individual
secrets within a particular environment context. Encrypted secrets are kept
as binary files within the project folder using hybrid RSA-AES cryptopgraphy.

## Features

- Self-serve for project contributors
- Scalable for a large amount of secrets (1 KMS API call to decrypt all secrets)
- CRUD operations on a per-secret basis
- Environment contexts (development, staging, production)

## Initialize Project

We have a project `my_project` that we'd like to initialize with 3 different
environment contexts (`development`, `staging` and `production`) with their own
KMS master keys.

```
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --env development --init --kms-key-id aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-123456111111
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --env staging --init --kms-key-id eeeeeeee-ffff-gggg-hhhh-123456222222
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --env production --init --kms-key-id iiiiiiii-jjjj-kkkk-llll-123456333333
```

This will initialize the project folder with a data directory of the following
structure:

```
$ pwd
/Users/bob/my_project
$ tree
.
└── code_crypt
    └── data
        ├── keys
        │   ├── development
        │   │   ├── encrypted_private_key.pem
        │   │   └── public_key.asc
        │   ├── production
        │   │   ├── encrypted_private_key.pem
        │   │   └── public_key.asc
        │   └── staging
        │       ├── encrypted_private_key.pem
        │       └── public_key.asc
        └── secrets
            ├── development
            ├── production
            └── staging
```

(Note: `--env` defaults to `development` and won't be explicitly used in this
guide going forward.)

## Encrypt Secrets

Single secrets can be encrypted with `--encrypt` option.

```
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --encrypt SOME_SECRET='a1b2c3'
```

In this case an encrypted binary file would be created at
`code_crypt/data/secrets/development/SOME_SECRET.bin`.

## Decrypt Secrets (CLI)

Single secrets can be decrypted with `--decrypt` option which returns a
plaintext value.

```
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --decrypt SOME_SECRETa1b2c3
```

Multiple secrets can be decrypted with the `--decrypt-all` option which returns
a JSON string of key-value pairs.

```
$ APP_ROOT=/Users/bob/my_project code-crypt --decrypt-all
{
    "SOME_SECRET": "a1b2c3"
}
```

## Decrypt Secrets (Application)

Prerequisite: Grant your application run-time authentication to its environment's respective
KMS master key.

Create a Code Crypt object and run the `decrypt()` function.

```python
from code_crypt import core as code_crypt

CC = code_crypt.CodeCrypt(app_root=MY_APP_ROOT, env=MY_ENV)
CC_SECRETS = CC.decrypt()
```

The resulting `CC_SECRETS` object is a dict of decrypted secret key-value pairs.

# Developer Setup

If you are interested in working on the codebase, setting up your development
environment is quick and easy.

```bash
$ make venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
